### Hayt (the query DSL)

If you wish to use Hayt you need to add it to your dependencies

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/cc.qbits/hayt.svg)](https://clojars.org/cc.qbits/hayt)


Then `require`/`use` `qbits.hayt` and you're good to go.

## Documentation

[codox generated documentation](http://mpenet.github.com/alia/#docs).

## Quickstart

Simple query execution using alia with hayt would look like this:

```clojure
(execute session (select :users
                         (where {:name :foo})
                         (columns :bar "baz")))
```


But first things first: here is an example of a complete session using
raw queries.


```clojure
(require '[qbits.alia :as alia])

(def session (alia/session {:session-keyspace "alia"
                            :contact-points ["localhost:9042"]
                            :load-balancing-local-datacenter "Analytics"}))
```

Sessions are separate so that you can interact with multiple
keyspaces from the same cluster definition.

```clojure
(def session (alia/connect cluster))

(alia/execute session "CREATE KEYSPACE alia
                       WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3};")
```



```clojure
   (alia/execute session "CREATE TABLE users (user_name varchar,
                                              first_name varchar,
                                              last_name varchar,
                                              auuid uuid,
                                              birth_year bigint,
                                              created timestamp,
                                              valid boolean,
                                              emails set<text>,
                                              tags list<bigint>,
                                              amap map<varchar, bigint>,
                                              PRIMARY KEY (user_name));")
  (alia/execute session "INSERT INTO users
                         (user_name, first_name, last_name, emails, birth_year, amap, tags, auuid,valid)
                         VALUES('frodo', 'Frodo', 'Baggins',
                         {'f@baggins.com', 'baggins@gmail.com'}, 1,
                         {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2}, [4, 5, 6],
                         1f84b56b-5481-4ee4-8236-8a3831ee5892, true);")

  ;; prepared statement with positional parameter(s)
  (def prepared-statement (alia/prepare session "select * from users where user_name=?;"))

  (alia/execute session prepared-statement {:values ["frodo"]})

  >> ({:created nil,
       :last_name "Baggins",
       :emails #{"baggins@gmail.com" "f@baggins.com"},
       :tags [4 5 6],
       :first_name "Frodo",
       :amap {"foo" 1, "bar" 2},
       :auuid #uuid "1f84b56b-5481-4ee4-8236-8a3831ee5892",
       :valid true,
       :birth_year 1,
       :user_name "frodo"})

  ;; prepared statement with named parameter(s)
  (def prepared-statement (alia/prepare session "select * from users where user_name= :name limit :lmt;"))

  (alia/execute session prepared-statement {:values {:name "frodo" :lmt (int 1)}})


```

### Asynchronous interfaces:

There are currently 3 interfaces to use the asynchronous methods of
the underlying driver, the fundamental one being a simple
`CompletableFuture` API, and then two alternative streaming APIs
built with **core.async** and **manifold**


### Async returning `CompletableFuture`

```clojure
@(execute-async session "select * from users;")

```

#### Async using clojure/core.async


`qbits.alia.async/execute-chan` has the same signature as the other execute
functions and returns a `clojure/core.async` channel of rows, or an exception instance.

The channel supports backpressure, controlled by buffer-sizes and as rows
are consumed from the channel more rows will be fetched to fill any buffers.

Once you run it you have a couple of options to pull data from it.

+ using `clojure.core.async/take!` which takes the channel as first argument
and a callback as second:

```clojure
(take! (execute-chan session "select * from users;")
       (fn [rows-or-exception]
         (do-something rows)))
```

+ using `clojure.core.async/<!!` to block and pull the rows/exception
  from the channel.

```clojure
(def rows-or-exception (<!! (execute-chan session "select * from users;")))
```

+ using `clojure.core.async/merge` you can run a list of queries in
  parallel and have the results fed to a single output chan:

```clojure
(let [merged (async/merge [(alia/execute-chan session (select :foo))
                           (alia/execute-chan session (select :bar))
                           (alia/execute-chan session (select :baz))])]
  (go
    (loop []
      (when-let [result (<! merged)]
        (println result)
        (recur)))))
```

`qbits.alia.async/execute` returns a `promise-chan` with just the first
page of results

`qbits.alia.async/execute-chan-pages` returns a channel of pages of results,
also supporting backpressure. The page objects are constructed by the
`:result-set-fn` option.


#### Async using manifold

`qbits.alia.manifold/execute-stream` has the same signature as other execute
functions and resturns a manifold stream of rows, or an exception instance

As with core.async, the stream supports backpressure and as rows are `take!`en
from the stream, more rows will be fetched according to available buffers.

`qbits.alia.manifold/execute` returns a `Deferred` with just the first page of
results

`qbits.alia.manifold/execute-stream-pages` returns a stream of pages of
results, supporting backpressure. The page objects are constructed by the
`:result-set-fn` option.


And it can do a lot more! Head to the
[codox generated documentation](http://mpenet.github.com/alia/#docs).

## Hayt (Query DSL)

There is a nicer way to write your queries using
[Hayt](https://github.com/mpenet/hayt), this should be familiar if you
know Korma or ClojureQL.
One of the major difference is that Hayt doesn't use macros and just
generates maps, so if you need to compose clauses or queries together
you can just use the clojure.core functions that work on maps.

Some examples:

```clojure

(use 'qbits.hayt)

(select :foo (where {:bar 2}))

;; this generates a map
>> {:select :foo :where {:bar 2}}

(update :foo
         (set-columns {:bar 1
                       :baz (inc-by 2)}
         (where [[= :foo :bar]
                 [> :moo 3]
                 [> :meh 4]
                 [:in :baz  [5 6 7]]]))


;; Composability using normal map manipulation functions

(def base (select :foo (where {:foo 1})))

(merge base
       (columns :bar :baz)
       (where {:bar 2})
       (order-by [:bar :asc])
       (using :ttl 10000))

;; To compile the queries just use ->raw

(->raw (select :foo))
> "SELECT * FROM foo;"

```

Alia supports hayt query direct execution, if you pass a non-compiled
query to `execute` or `execute-async`, it will be compiled and cached on a LU cache with a threshold of
100 (the cache function is user settable), so to be used carefully. The same is true with `prepare`.

Ex
```clojure
(execute session (select :users (where {:name :foo})))
```

It covers everything that is possible with CQL3 (functions, handling
of collection types and their operations, ddl, prepared statements,
etc).
If you want to know more about it head to its [codox documentation](http://mpenet.github.com/hayt/codox/qbits.hayt.html) or
[Hayt's tests](https://github.com/mpenet/hayt/blob/master/test/qbits/hayt/core_test.clj).
